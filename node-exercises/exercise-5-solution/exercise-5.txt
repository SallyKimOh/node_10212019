Exercise 5

https://github.com/t4d-classes/node_10212019

1. Create a new Express application. Use a JSON file to configure the port number, file name and path of the data file (data.json) and the file name and path of a log file (history.log).

2. Create a REST endpoint for adding a new car resource. For the car capture the make, model, year, color and price.

3. When the REST endpoint is called, save the car to a file named data.json. Log the verb, url, status code of each request to the Express application to a file named history.log.

4. Add a new REST endpoint which returns all cars from the data.json file.

5. Create a second node script which uses super agent to add two new cars and then returns all of the cars (be sure the added cars are included in the returned collection).

6. Write unit tests to test the following:

Making a REST endpoint request to add a car
Making a REST endpoint request to get all cars
Adding a car to the data.json file
Getting all cars from the data.json file

7. Run the Express application and second script and ensure all works. Run the unit tests and ensure they work.

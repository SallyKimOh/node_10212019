Using the example code below in `simple-concat.js', write a program which reads two text files, 'a.txt' and 'b.txt', concats them together, and writes a new text file named 'c.txt'. You may modify the 'simple-concat.js' file or create a new file. To run the program, use the following command from the terminal:

node ./simple-concat.js

If you use another file name, then replace `simple-concat.js` with the name of the file you choose.

You will create several versions of this program:

a. A version which uses callbacks.

b. A version which uses promises. Do not use promisify.

c. A version which uses async/await.

Bonus: d. A version which uses promisify and async/await.

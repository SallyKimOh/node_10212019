Exercise 2

https://github.com/t4d-classes/node_10212019

1. Create a new Node.js project. Remember, this is done by creating a 'package.json' file. Copy the 'cars.json' and 'db.json' file to the folder where the 'package.json' file is located. 

2. Install the Commander and SuperAgent packages found here:

https://www.npmjs.com/package/commander
https://www.npmjs.com/package/superagent

Install these two packages are normal dependencies.

3. Install the JSON Server package found here: https://github.com/typicode/json-server

Install JSON Server as a development dependency.

4. Add a script entry named 'rest' and configure it to run the following command:

'json-server --port 3010 ./db.json'

5. Write a Node.js program in a file named 'upload-cars.js' which does the following:

a. Accepts a command line argument named 'source' which is path to a JSON file containing car data.

b. Uses the value of the command line argument to open and read the car data file.

c. POSTs the car data to the JSON server REST service. Each car should be posted individually, but all POSTs should be initiated in the same task. Use the promise-based approach. You may also use async/await if you would like.

d. The command should be executed like this:

node ./upload-cars.js --source cars.json

6. View the results of the program by browsing to 'http://localhost:3010/cars'.

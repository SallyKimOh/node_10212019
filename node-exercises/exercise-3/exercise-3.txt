Exercise 3

https://github.com/t4d-classes/node_10212019

1. Create a new program which copies a file. The name of the source and target files should be specified as command line arguments.

2. To perform the copy do not use 'readFile', 'writeFile' or 'copyFile', use 'readStream' and 'writeStream'. Use the structure provided and described by the index.js file. This structure will result in a file-copy.js file, with the command line arguments passed into the fileCopy function. The fileCopy function should not use the commander module directly.

3. The fileCopy function should return a promise. The promise is resolved when the write stream is closed.

4. Once the file copy is complete write a message to the console indicating that the file copy is complete.

5. The program should execute with the following command:

node ./file-copy.js --source input.txt --target output.txt
